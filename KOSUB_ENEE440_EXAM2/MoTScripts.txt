The MoT commands, element-by-element:
function 0
8-bit <device# = 03>
8-bit <function# 0 = 00>
8-bit <checksum>

function 1
8-bit <device# = 03>
8-bit <function# 1 = 01>
8-bit <checksum>

Sample command string, function0 : 03 00 
  sending  :0300FD
Sample command string, function1 : 03 01
  sending : :0301FC

You can use the MoT command generation script (hex2MoTcmd.c) in order to generate your own command and its corresponding checksum.
